StateSnapshots are the source of truth for data. They are immutable records that
comprehensively describe the entire system's state. Each StateSnapshot points to
a single parent StateSnapshot except for the initial snapshot.

StateSnapshots are created by an action that takes in a previous snapshot and
produces a new one. In addition, each StateSnapshot contains a Transaction,
which is a record of the action that produced the current snapshot.

TODO: A more efficient system would be to use Transactions as the source of
truth which describe only the differential between the current state and the
previous state. However, this will require implementing an internal state
diffing DSL. At any transaction, a SnapShot could then be deterministically
generated by walking the Transactions tree and playing all the diffs in
sequence.
